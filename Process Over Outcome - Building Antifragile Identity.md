# Process Over Outcome: Building Antifragile Identity

## Core Thesis
Why focusing on inputs creates more resilient self-concept - how process-oriented thinking builds antifragile identity that gets stronger under stress rather than breaking.

## Key Notes to Reference

### Literature Notes
- [[Trust the Process Framework]] - Systematic approach to process-focused development
